# Housing-Price-Regression-Models

Linear Regression with Python
In this notebook we will cover the following linear algorithms:

Linear Regression
Robust Regression
Ridge Regression
LASSO Regression
Elastic Net
Polynomial Regression
We are going to use the USA_Housing dataset. Since house price is a continues variable, this is a regression problem.

The data contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
'Area Population': Population of city hou se is located in
'Price': Price that the house sold at
'Address': Address for the house

Summary:

In this notebook you discovered the linear regression algorithm for machine learning.

You covered a lot of ground including:

The common linear regression models (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, ...).
The representation used by the model.
Learning algorithms used to estimate the coefficients in the model.
Rules of thumb to consider when preparing data for use with linear regression.
How to evaluate a linear regression model.
